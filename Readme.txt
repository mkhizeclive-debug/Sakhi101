Upgrade Notes:
* While it is not required, it is strongly advised you uninstall older versions of EndNote before you install EndNote 2025. Before you begin, back up custom styles, filters, connection files and databases. 

Demo Notes:
* This is a fully functional trial version of EndNote 2025. You will have 30 days after you first use the program to evaluate EndNote and all of its features. After those 30 days are up, the program will revert to a feature-restricted EndNote Viewer. 

After the program reverts to an EndNote Viewer, you will still be able to open EndNote libraries, search, sort, and print references. However, with the EndNote Viewer you cannot:
- Add or edit references in a library that has 10 or more references already in it.
- Format more than 10 citations in a paper
- Retrieve more than 10 references from a remote database
- Import more than 10 references
- Export more than 10 references at one time
- Sync with EndNote online

You can purchase a product key and convert your installation to the full unrestricted version of EndNote 2025 by clicking Activate EndNote from the Help menu. 

* Installing the Demo
If you have a full, upgrade, or multi-user version of EndNote installed on your system, please note that the EndNote Demo installer will replace Cite While You Write related files. When your demo period has expired or if you choose to use Cite While You Write or Services from the full version, follow the instructions provided in the Installing Cite While You Write Support in Word topic in the help file.
